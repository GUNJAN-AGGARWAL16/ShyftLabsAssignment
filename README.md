Answer 1: 
1. The 'findIndex' function effectively solves the problem by iterating through the input ArrayList until it finds the first occurrence of -1. It then returns the index where -1 is found.
2. The 'main' function handles user input, populating the ArrayList with positive integers until -1 is entered. It then calls the 'findIndex' function to find the desired index and prints the result.
